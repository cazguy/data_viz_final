            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>The design process for this visualization began as primarily a code-first, design-second process. The
                initial project that I created consisted of multiple different chart styles, exploring somewhat
                disconnected parts of the data, only accessible one at a time. However, once I had become more familiar
                with the dataset and noticed how disjointed the project felt, I scrapped the entire code and started
                from scratch again. The first project did have a choropleth map that functioned well and was
                aesthetically pleasing, so, I decided to create the new visualization centered around a more interactive
                map that was able to display more data.</p>
            <p>The main deviations from the initial project were a much greater deal of time spent on interactivity and
                cohesiveness rather than styling for the page itself. The original project had little to no
                interactivity other than a pop-up tooltip when hovering over chart elements. I also decided to leave the
                elements, other than the visualization itself, much simpler as to not take away from the visualization.
            </p>
            <p>The dataset I chose for this project was extremely rich, with over 40 different attributes. I struggled
                when narrowing down which attributes to use in the visualization as it was tempting to include more
                attributes than I did and being unable to present a finished project by the deadline. A particular
                challenge I faced when using this dataset was the AgeCategory attribute. Rather than an exact age for
                each row, it was divided into discrete groups of ages. This made it difficult to simply calculate an
                average for each state. Ultimately, I assigned each age group a number, starting with 1 for the first
                group in the ordinal set and calculating an average based on the assigned numbers.</p>

            <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
            <p>As mentioned, the main goal for the final iteration of this project was a single view that allowed
                visualization of the dataset. The single map in the new visualization allows the user to not feel as
                though they are navigating completely different pages. Because each row of the dataset had the state
                listed, creating a geographically based visualization seemed logical. Despite the choropleth map
                allowing the user to easily toggle between different visualizations of different data, the coloring and
                legend do not easily convey exact values for each state, therefore, functionality was added which
                allowed the user to see the data upon clicking on a state.</p>
            <p>As for color-encoding, an interpolation of reds was used for the visualizing the percentage of the state
                population in the dataset who had a heart attack. The color red is very commonly associated with the
                heart. As for the rest of the colors, my focus was to pick colors that contrasted with each other to
                clearly see the difference on the map when they were selected. Ordering for the different data
                selections was arbitrary except for the heart attack data which was listed first as it was the primary
                focus of the visualization. The page other than the visualization was left clean so as not to distract
                the user.

            <h2>Findings and Evidence</h2>
            <p>The visualization helped to illustrate interesting relationships between different variables and the lack
                of a relationship where one might expect one.</p>
            <p>Average age tended to be the biggest predictor of states which had a higher percentage of people who had
                a heart attack.
            </p>

            <img src="aa_data.png" alt="Average Age Data">
            <p>As can been seen in the two images, states with the highest average ages, such as Florida, Arkansas,
                Arizona, and Maine, tended to have a higher rate of heart attacks.</p>
            <p>We also see a slight overlap in average BMI and heart attacks, although this effect is mainly
                concentrated in the Midwest. The strongest correlation between BMI and heart attacks appears in West
                Virginia as seen in the image below.</p>
            <img src="bmi_data.png" alt="BMI Data">
            <p>Interestingly, I did not see any compelling connection between average sleep hours and heart attacks,
                although, the spread between the maximum average and minimum average was quite small at only about 20
                minutes of sleep. It is fascinating to notice the geographically stratified differences in average sleep
                between the northern latitudes and the southern latitudes.</p>
